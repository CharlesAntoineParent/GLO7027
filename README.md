# Projet GLO-7027

We used python **3.9** to run our scripts.

After downloading the zip create folder **data** in the root of the repo


You can now download the data at this url : http://fsg-p-ftp01.fsg.ulaval.ca/RichardKhoury.zip


after extracting it, you copy the content of the zip in your data folder. The config should look like this:

```
GLO7027
└── data
    └── analytics
    └── test
    └── train
    
```
